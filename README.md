**Project Title: PowerBI-Mobile-Sales-Analysis**

**Problem Statement:**
In the competitive mobile phone market, businesses struggle to gain actionable insights from sales data to optimize inventory, marketing strategies, and customer engagement. Without a structured visualization tool, it becomes challenging to track sales trends, understand customer preferences, and analyze payment behaviors efficiently. The absence of a centralized dashboard leads to difficulty in identifying top-performing products, seasonal sales patterns, and revenue distribution across different regions and brands.

**Solution:**
To address these challenges, I developed a comprehensive **Mobile Sales Dashboard** using **Power BI**. This dashboard consolidates mobile sales data into interactive visualizations that provide deep insights into key business metrics. The solution is structured into three core analytical sections:

**1. Main Dashboard Overview**
   - **Total Sales & Revenue Summary:** Displays overall revenue, number of transactions, and units sold.
   - **Yearly & Monthly Sales Trends:** Line charts to identify peak sales periods and seasonal trends.
   - **Sales by City (Map View):** Geographical visualization of sales distribution for regional analysis.
   - **Top-Selling Mobile Models:** Bar chart highlighting the most popular mobile phones among customers.
   - **Filters for Customization:** Enables users to filter data by year, month, city, and product model for personalized analysis.

   **Impact:**
   - Identified highest revenue-generating products.
   - Optimized inventory distribution based on regional sales data.
   - Recognized seasonal demand trends for strategic marketing planning.
